My senior seminar project for my Bachelor's Degree

Implementations of Gaussian Elimination to solve systems of Linear
equations and Jacobi Iteration to estimate solutions to
systems of linear equations.

Implemented sequentially in C and Haskell.
Implemented using C and MPI as well.

Succesfully ran on data sets of various sizes and on cluster sizes
ranging from 2-10. Not all programs worked on all data sets or all
cluster sizes. This code is not robust at all. It was an
initial experimentation with distributed computing and, in the
case of the Haskell code, functional programming.

Originally implemented using Windows 7 and MPICH2. 
Note: MPICH2 is no longer supported on Windows.

I used other code to generate matrices and check the proper solutions, but that
code is not included here.
